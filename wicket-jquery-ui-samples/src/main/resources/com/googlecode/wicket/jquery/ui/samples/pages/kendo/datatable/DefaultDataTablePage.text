This sample shows some of the Kendo UI's grid capabilities, you can for instance sort and/or group columns.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Note 1:</b> The sort is performed server side if the <tt>IDataProvider</tt> implements <tt>ISortStateLocator&lt;String&gt;</tt><br/>
<b>Note 2:</b> At this stage, the grouping is performed client side. That means that only data on the current page are grouped.<br/>
